<!--
  This inline script needs to run **before** the first paint to avoid the notorious
  "flash of un-themed content" when the user has dark-mode turned on. In Astro a
  plain <script> tag placed inside a component is compiled into a separate
  module that is loaded **after** the HTML is parsed. That is too late â€“ the
  page has already flashed.

  Adding the `is:inline` attribute tells Astro to leave the script exactly where
  it is in the markup so it executes immediately while the browser is still
  constructing the DOM.

<script is:inline>
(function () {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('theme');
  const dark =
    saved === 'dark' || (!saved && matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches);

  if (dark) {
    document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
  }
})();
</script>
