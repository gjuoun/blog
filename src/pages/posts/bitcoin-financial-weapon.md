Back in 2021, Peter Thiel—this super famous venture capitalist guy—threw out a total bombshell. He said Bitcoin might be a “Chinese financial weapon” to mess with the US dollar. Like, what?! He’s all about Bitcoin himself, but he was worried China could use it to throw the dollar off its game. It’s kind of ironic because China was already cracking down on crypto at the time. Still, it got me thinking—could Bitcoin really be a secret weapon in some global power play? 

## China Slamming the Door on Crypto

Speaking of China, they didn’t mess around in 2021. They straight-up banned cryptocurrency transactions and minings. Before that, they were the champs of Bitcoin mining, controlling about 70% of it worldwide. After the ban, though, miners packed up and headed to places like the US and Canada. By 2025, China’s share dropped to just 15%, and the West swooped in. 

## The West: Bitcoin’s New BFFs

Fast forward to 2023–2025, and it feels like everyone in the West, especially the US, is obsessed with Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy are sitting on insane amounts—like 580,000 BTC, which is 2.7% of all Bitcoin out there! Tesla and Marathon Digital Holdings are in on it too, and with Bitcoin ETFs popping off in 2024, big institutions own over 1.25 million BTC now. China’s still got some individual owners, but the West is definitely flexing with the big stacks. It’s like a crypto gold rush over here
Bitcoin’s acceptance has been off the charts lately. By 2025, over 560 million people worldwide own crypto—that’s 6.8% of everyone! In the US, 28% of adults have some, and huge companies like Microsoft and Home Depot are cool with Bitcoin payments now. Oh, and the price? It smashed past $100,000 in December 2024. Some folks, like Cathie Wood, even think it could hit $1 million soon. It’s not just for tech nerds anymore—it’s everywhere.


## Dollar vs. Yuan: Who’s Shaking More?

So, with Bitcoin blowing up, which currency’s feeling it the most—the US dollar or the Chinese yuan?

### The Dollar’s Still Boss

The dollar took a hit in 2025, dropping about 11%—its worst slump since the ‘70s. And yeah, when the dollar dips, Bitcoin tends to soar. But let’s be real: the dollar’s still the king of currencies. Bitcoin’s growing, but it’s not ready to knock it off the throne yet. It’s like the dollar’s this tough old champ, and Bitcoin’s just throwing some jabs. More on that here.

### The Yuan’s Wobbly Moment

The yuan, though? It’s looking a bit shakier. China’s economy is slowing down—growth’s under 5% in 2025—and trade fights with the US aren’t helping. In April 2025, the yuan hit its weakest point since 2023. Normally, when a currency tanks, people might jump to Bitcoin, but China’s crypto ban makes that tricky. They’re also pushing their own digital money, the e-CNY, to keep things locked down. So, the yuan’s vulnerable, but Bitcoin’s not hitting it as hard as it could. Check it out here.

## Wrapping It Up: Bitcoin’s the Cool Underdog

Watching Bitcoin’s journey in the global financial system is truly fascinating. While it hasn’t yet surpassed major currencies like the dollar or the yuan, I’m optimistic about its future. With its rapid growth and increasing adoption, I believe Bitcoin has the potential to become a global “digital gold” asset. If this momentum continues, it could play a significant role alongside traditional currencies.
